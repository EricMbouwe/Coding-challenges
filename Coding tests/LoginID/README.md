# STUDENTS PROFILES

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is a list of student's profiles that you can filter by name or by tags.

The project includes these features:

- A List of student profiles  
- Add tags to profiles
- Filtering profiles by names and by tag
- Display grades list in an expandable view (accordion)

The app is using [Hatchways API](https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/students) as API.
