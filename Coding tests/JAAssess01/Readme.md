## STRING CHALLENGE
Have the function StringChallenge(str) read the str parameter being passed which will be a string of HTML DOM elements and plain text. The elements that will be used are: b, i, em, div, p. For example: if str is "<div><b><p>hello world</p></b></div>" then this string of DOM elements is nested correctly so your program should return the string true.

If a string is not nested correctly, return the first element encountered where, if changed into a different element, would result in a properly formatted string. If the string is not formatted properly, then it will only be one element that needs to be changed. For example: if str is "<div><i>hello</i>world</b>" then your program should return the string div because if the first <div> element were changed into a <b>, the string would be properly formatted.

Examples
```
Input: "<div><div><b></b></div></p>"
Output: div
Input: "<div>abc</div><p><em><i>test test test</b></em></p>"
Output: i
```

## Math Challenge

Have the function MathChallenge(str) take str which will be a string representing a polynomial containing only (+/-) integers, a letter, parenthesis, and the symbol "^", and return it in expanded form. For example: if str is "(2x^2+4)(6x^3+3)", then the output should be "12x^5+24x^3+6x^2+12". Both the input and output should contain no spaces. The input will only contain one letter, such as "x", "y", "b", etc. There will only be four parenthesis in the input and your output should contain no parenthesis. The output should be returned with the highest exponential element first down to the lowest.

More generally, the form of str will be: ([+/-]{num}[{letter}[{^}[+/-]{num}]]...[[+/-]{num}]...)(copy) where "[]" represents optional features, "{}" represents mandatory features, "num" represents integers and "letter" represents letters such as "x".

Examples
```
Input: "(1x)(2x^-2+1)"
Output: x+2x^-1
Input: "(-1x^3)(3x^3+2)"
Output: -3x^6-2x^3
```
