# Exercise
Write a program that given a list of guarantees, their end dates and an arbitrary end date, prints if the guarantee has ended or not.

### Level 1
Expand the script to print out how many days are left in the guarantee or how many days ago the same has ended.

### Level 2
Add functionality to pass arguments to the script. The extra argument should be another file name. No validation check needed, just copy paste the existing file and rename it.
